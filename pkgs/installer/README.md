# Installer

The aim with this package is to install all the cli tools contained within the repo, globally, somewhere on $PATH, for convenience sake.

There are some interesting things here, which I haven't covered before.


# Uninstaller

It's probably worth also building an uninstaller alongside this.

The `timers` package creates a global dir and makes a database in there. That should be removed when doing global uninstall.
